# README

This repo contains the core Python code used for my masters project, "Feature Extraction
and Machine Learning Techniques for Musical Genre Determination," for which I will be
receiving a Masters of Science in 
[Electrical Engineering](https://www.csun.edu/engineering-computer-science/electrical-computer-engineering/) 
from [California State University, Northridge](https://www.csun.edu/) in December 2017. 
My advisor at CSUN is 
[Dr. Xiyi Hang](http://www.csun.edu/faculty/profiles/xiyi.hang.14). 
My paper and this code is also hosted on [ScholarWorks via the CSUN library](http://scholarworks.csun.edu/handle/10211.3/199917).

My project relies heavily on [the FMA dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) and the
[accompanying paper, "FMA: A Dataset for Music Analysis", by MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Kirell
Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst, and  Xavier Bresson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840),
though my code is adaptable to other datasets. All code in this repo is released under the
terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).
